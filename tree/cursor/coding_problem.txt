### Coding problem.

Please implement a Merkle-tree in python, typescript, rust, or go with the following constraints:

1. It should construct a merkle-tree on the cloned `postgres` repository.
2. For $k$ files, you should only do $k$ `/upload` calls to the server.
3. After you are done embedding, I will run a `modify.py` script that will randomly edit $m$ files in the repo. You are then to run the syncing process which is allowed $m$ `/upload` calls and $2m$ `/check` calls.
4. In the final state, the `/check` for your root (`/`) should be the same as the hash when you call `/check` on `/` on the server.

For the problem:


1. you should implement both the client and the server.
